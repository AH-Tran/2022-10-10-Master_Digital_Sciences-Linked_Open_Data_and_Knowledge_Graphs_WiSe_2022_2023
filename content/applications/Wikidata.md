![Wikidata Example Part 1](images/wikidata_5.PNG)

Label - A label is the exact name of a wikidata item
Item identifier - Identifies an item uniquely, always starts with Q followed by numbers
Description - Describes the wikidata item further with a set of characters
Alias - Other most common names and different spelling of the item
Statement - In a statement blog there is further linked information about the wikidata item. Linked information always needs to be referenced to a source
Property - Identifies a property uniquely, always starts with P followed by numbers. Properties specifies the "type" of an information
Qualifier - Links an item to a specific qualifier, so it links an item to an specific instance that this item belongs to
Rank - When there are multiple information regarding a specific statement, you can modify with the rank the most visible information. One good example would be population. When you have a population in year 2000 and want to update it to a more current value, like pupulation in year 2007, you add the value, add the reference that proves your value is right, set the rank of the population 2007 to a higher possibility and the rank of population in year 2000 to a lower possibility.

There are different possibilities to contribute data: automated, half-automated and manual
Different online tools:
    - Mix'n'Match: contains lists of important concepts from reliable sources and allows to match the names to Wikidata entries with one click
    - The primary source tool: allows for a curation workflow for data donations to Wikidata, where Wikidata editors can review, edit, or reject data offered to the community
    - Quickstatements 2: allows users to create items and upload lists of statements based on input in tab-separated format exported from spreadsheets
    - fatameh: allows users to create fully populated items about scientific papers with one click

An example of a Wikidata Project - another possibility to contribute data. This project refers to streets in Northrhine-Westphalia (germany). As you can see there are still alot of missing values that you can contribute. The last column is the OpenStreetMapID. So the information is even linked to other services.
