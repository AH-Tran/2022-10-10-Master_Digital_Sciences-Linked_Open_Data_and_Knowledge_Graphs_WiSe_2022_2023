# SPARQL & Cypher

## SPARQL

- SPARQL (pronounced “sparkle”) is an RDF query language for the Semantic Web and first appeared in 2008.
- SPARQL is developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and along with RDF and OWL, it is one of the three core technologies of the Semantic Web. 
- The syntax here is relatively easy to learn, similar to SQL, and is reminiscent of English sentence structure. Like this example: "Return me all items that contain house cats.“
- SPARQL is used to represent information from data stored as RDF format. The results from the queries can then in turn be visualized in different ways. For example, as in the Wikidata Query Service as a table, timeline or map.
