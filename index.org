  collaboratively but which will not be made public.
- There are no stupid questions. Please feel free to ask anything at
  anytime.
- Mistakes are to be expected, respected, inspected, and corrected.
- In case you have any disabilities that hamper the usage of the
  material, the participation in the course or the exam - please
  contact me.
- No need to buy any book or other material.
- Helpful skills for this course for this course

** Learning outcomes

- The course introduces the basic concepts of Linked Open Data (LOD)
  as well as the construction of knowledge graphs.

- Equiped with this understanding participants will explore real world
  applications like Wikidata and Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG).

- After finishing this course students are able to use, extend and
  construct knowledge graphs.

** Assingments

There are three assignments:
- Presenting a basic topic and an application
- Presenting a research paper
- Performing a project

**** 1. Presenting a basic topic and an application

- In teams of 2 (or 3)
- One basic topic and one appliacation
- 20 minutes presenation + 10 minutes discussion
- There will be time to work on both at the  2022-10-24
- Basic topics will be presented at 2022-10-31
- Applications will be presented at 2022-11-07
- Also excercises possible
- Content in markdown and submitted to the GitHub repository; if
  wanted presentation slides
- Each team member should present a part of each topic

***** Basic topics

- RDF Schema
- Graphs, Centrality, Graphs Quality
- SPARQL and Cypher

- Schema.org (Anh Huy + Natasha)
- JSON-LD

***** Applications

- Dbpedia
- Wikidata

- (CYC)

**** 2. Presenting a research paper

- Every participants presents one research paper but teams up with
  somebody to get initial feedback before the presentation in the
  larger group.
- There will be a set of publications suggested but it is possible to
  suggest others.
- 20 minutes presenstation time (including 5 min discussion)
- Can be supported by slides but must not be the case.
- Basic notes are added to the GitHub repo (bullet point list)

**** 3. Performing a project 

- Further information following
- Done in groups of 2 (or 3 if needed)
- Presentation at the last session
- Report will be graded

** Grading

- Grading will be done based on the project and the project report.

** Schedule

Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) Pyramid, Framework, Continuum

- "Data are the symbolic representations of observable properties"
- "Information is relevant, or usable, or significant, or meaningful, or processed, data"
- "Knowledge is know-how, for example, how a system works. It is what
   makes possible the transformation of information into
   instructions. It makes control of a system possible. To control a
   system is to make it work efficiently." (Ackoff 1980)
- "Wisdom adds value, which requires the mental function we call
  judgement. The value of an act is never independent of the actor…
  [ethical and aesthetic values] are unique and personal.
  wisdom-generating systems are ones that man will never be able to
  assign to automata. It may well be that wisdom, which is essential
  to the effective pursuit of ideals, and the pursuit of ideals
  itself, are the characteristics that differentiate man from
  machines." (Ackoff 1989, 9)

*** Basic terms (Thinks-Pair-Share)

- What is knowledge?
- What are graphs?
- How do we represent knowledge

*** Graphs

- Graphs (or Networks)
  - nodes / vertices
  - edges / links
